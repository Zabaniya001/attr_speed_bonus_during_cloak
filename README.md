# Custom Attribute: Speed Bonus During Cloak

Custom Attribute that utilizes [TF2 Cloak API](https://github.com/Zabaniya001/TF2_CloakAPI) & Nosoop's [custom attributes framework](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFCustAttr). 

It gives you a speed bonus while you're cloaked.

## How to apply the attribute

`"speed boost during cloak" 	"value"`

Shove it inside tf_custom_attributes.txt or anything else that supports custom attributes. It also supports Custom Weapons X, so you can shove it inside the weapon's config.

Example stats: "1.125"
As a spy your speed will go from 320 ( base movement speed ) to 360.
